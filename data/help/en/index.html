Towns just opened its gates. Welcome to a world where your success depends only on you, types of buildings you build, and how you interact with players. The most important thing you need to know in the beginning is how to extract <strong>resources</strong> and how to use them to <strong>construct</strong> buildings. In Towns, there are five basic types of resources that allow you to build and expand your town. These resources are <strong>wood</strong>, <strong>stone</strong>, <strong>iron</strong>, and <strong>fuel</strong>.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resource extraction</strong> is performed by buildings that allow this feature. These buildings include your main building which, however, has a low effectiveness. In the beginning, however, it is enough. Click on the main building. In the menu at the bottom right of the screen, click on the extraction icon. Once the extraction of the nearest tree / rock is complete, the countdown starts. After it has elapsed, you can use this function again. You can watch status of your resources at the bottom right of the screen. These resources can be immediately used to build and further expand the town, or buy additional functions.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Building</strong> is a function that again only certain buildings allow. Each of them is specialized in construction of various types of buildings. Your main building, for example, specializes in construction of buildings that are required to expand your town. In the menu at the bottom right of the screen, click on the building/construction icon. Once you do this, the expansion black circles appear around your building. You can build buildings only inside or on the boundary of one of these circles. The next step is to select the building you want to build. You have to have enough resources (which are going to be used for construction). If you're using the main building and the existing buildings offer is not enough for you, we encourage you to build the <strong>Builder</strong>, with which you will then be able to build plenty of other necessary buildings. Click on the building you have selected, place it on the edge of any expansion circle, and click on the small building icon, located next to the new building. Then the countdown starts. After the time is up, you can use this function again.

You can learn about <strong>other functions</strong>, such as the attack, right <a href="functions">here</a>. Feel free to experiment. Eventually, you create the most amazing town in the world and become the master of the island. Gradually, you can also create your own buildings and much more. Remember that the evolution is an organic process, because only continuous expansion and improvement create the best results. Good luck!
