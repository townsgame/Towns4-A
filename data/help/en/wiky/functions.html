<strong>Functions</strong> are activated by clicking on an appropriate icon in the bottom menu. The basic functions include:
<br />

  <h2>Extraction</h2>
</td>

  First, it is important to choose a building through which you want to extract/exploit objects. You can exploit <strong>trees and rocks</strong>. The player gets <strong>wood and fuel</strong> from the trees, and <strong>stone, iron</strong> and fuel from the rocks. In the beginning you can use even the <strong>Main building</strong> to perform the extraction. This building can extract both trees and rocks, but with a very little efficiency. First off, click on your selected building. Then click on the extraction icon. The extraction can be both successful (the tree is cut off / the rock is exploited, and you get resources), and unsuccessful. If the extraction fails, you fill find a report in your information, for example: &quot;[Main building] Damaged a tree ...&quot;. After the function is restored, you can use the extraction again.

    The process is similar to the extraction. It is important to first select the building you want to build with. Every type of building that allows this function offers different variety of new buildings that can be built, and the effectiveness of their construction. After clicking on the building, a window with details appears. According to the state of your resources and your preference, choose a building that suits you best. After the selection, the window is closed and you can start moving the new building on the map. Next to the building there is a small icon, which when clicked triggers the construction process (and consumes the corresponding resources). You can only place the building in the black expansion circles (or on their edge), which have appeared around your current buildings. When the construction begins, the countdown is triggered. During this time the function cannot be used in the builder building again.

    Functions associated with construction include <strong>expansion</strong> and <strong>antiexpansion</strong>. Every building has these functions pre-defined. They determine the size of circles within which you can (expansion) or cannot (antiexpansion; some types of buildings do have this) build a new building. Antiexpansion at your buildings influences only other towns and do not affect your own buildings.

  <h2>Attacks</h2>

  This function (its kinds) is associated with some buildings (f. e. towers) and allows you to attack other players or objects in the game. The kinds of this function are total attack, i. e. total destruction, and <strong>occupation</strong>, i. e. building damage to 1 life point take-over.
  <br /><br />
  The attack is done by selecting a building that you want to use to perform it with. Mark the attack function. Once you have chosen a suitable building, click on it (its base) and select the marked attack function, which quickly triggers the attack. You can also display a window with details before the attack by clicking on a sword icon. This window contains useful information such as if you can win, and so on. After the attack is over, the information is displayed in the report. More details you can find in messages - reports tab.
