<h2>Map</h2>

The center of the game is the game map. There are various types of terrain on the map, such as the sea, forest, clay, etc. Each of these terrains has a different hardness and profitability. Every building has different requirements on the terrain. For example, water has almost no hardness; therefore you cannot build almost anything there except the bridge. On the game map, there are obviously ALL objects including buildings of other players.
<br /><br />
<strong>Moving the map</strong> is simple. The map can be easily &quot;scrolled&quot; by mouse. You can also use the keyboard - moving is done with the WASD (or arrow) keys. You can also click (or touch on touch devices) on one of the edges of the map, and it will cause its movement in that direction. If you want the map to move diagonally, click on one of the edges of the map (e. g. top), then click on one of the adjacent edges (e. g. left) and keep clicking on it - it will cause the diagonal movement.
<br />
<h2>Objects</h2>

Any object or building can be selected by clicking on its base, which causes its details to appear in the right corner of the bottom menu.
<br />
<h2>Bottom menu</h2>

<p>To interact with the game, it is important to familiarize yourself with the bottom menu located below the map. There are various icons in this menu that you can click on to call an associated function.
  <br />
  <br />
In the left corner of the bottom menu there is a panel with actual information - reports.
<br />
Click on the bubble icon with three dots to open <strong>the message window</strong> which allows you to view message history, send a new message, and more.<br />
  <br />
  In the right corner of the bottom menu there are <strong>tabs</strong> with different buildings. Automatically there is a tab with the <strong>Main building</strong>, which cannot be canceled. You can add new tabs by clicking on any building or object (any, even a tree or rock), and consequently on the corresponding icon (the icon with the up-arrow). On each tab there are icons that can be clicked on to call an associated function on the building or object. One of these functions is called  <strong>Center</strong> (the icon in the middle, with a cross). When you click on its icon, the map moves and the object or building appears in its center.</p>
