<title>Guide - basics</title>
<p><strong><u>Towns</u></strong> just opened its gates. Welcome to a world where your success depends only on you, types of buildings you build, and how you interact with players. The most important thing you need to know in the beginning is how to extract <strong>resources</strong> and how to use them to <strong>construct</strong> buildings.<br />
  <br />
  In Towns, there are five basic types of resources that allow you to build and expand your town. These resources are: <br /> 
  <img src="../../image/icons/res_wood.png" width="15" height="15" /><strong>wood</strong>, <img src="../../image/icons/res_stone.png" width="15" height="15" /><strong>stone</strong>, <img src="../../image/icons/res_iron.png" width="15" height="15" /><strong>iron</strong>, <img src="../../image/icons/res_fuel.png" width="15" height="15" /><strong>fuel</strong> and <img src="../../image/icons/res_gold.png" width="15" height="15" /><strong>gold</strong><br />
  <br />
The following pages will guide you from registration to a small simple town. If you close this guide, you can reopen it by clicking on the <strong>?</Strong> icon in the bottom right corner. <br />

<title>Extraction of resources</title>


You can <strong><u>gain resources</u></strong> also by using your main building. Its effectiveness is very small, that is, it has only basic equipment for extraction. If you have not built any other building yet, the main building will be necessary to use for it. <br />
<br />
<strong><u>1) You must first select the Main building. You can do it by using the map or tabs:</u></strong><br />
<table width="200" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../image/screen2.png" width="215" border="2"/></td>
    <td><img src="../image/screen3.png" width="215" border="2" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Select using map </strong></td>
    <td><strong>Select using tabs </strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br />
<strong><u>2) You can then extract:</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>When extracting the guide window will close, you can re-open it using the icon ? in the bottom right corner. </strong><br />
<br />
<img src="../image/screen4.png" width="444" height="250" /><br />
<br />
Upon finishing you will be notified of the outcome (bottom left corner) and you will gain raw materials.<br />
You can extract resources again when the time on the extraction button is up.
<hr>
<title>Construction</title>

Basic buildings that you want to build from the beginning are called <strong>builder</strong>, <strong>mine</strong>, and <strong>lumberjack</strong>.<br />
<br />
<table width="450" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td align="left" valign="top">To build the Builder select the Main building and click on the construction icon. Choose from the list the Builder and place it on the map where you want to build it. You can only construct buildings in the black circle around the main building, and the building must not be placed over other buildings, trees, rocks or water. </td>
    <td align="left" valign="top"><img src="../../image/icons/f_create.png" width="35" height="35" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br />
<br />
<img src="../image/screen5.png" width="450" height="250" /><br />
<br />
You can rotate the building using the mouse wheel. <br />
<br />
<hr>
<title>Builder</title>

<strong><u>Builder</u></strong> offers a wide variation of buildings that you can build and use for further expansion of your town, including the <strong>warehouse</strong>, which can be used to build the above mentioned <strong>mine</strong> and <strong>lumberjack</strong>. As the name suggests, these buildings can be used for gaining wood or stone with high efficiency (i. e. you can make more raw materials from one object).
<br />
<br />
Once you have built the Builder, select it and click on the construction icon. You will see a choice of several buildings. Select the <strong>warehouse</strong> and build it.<br />
<br />
<img src="../image/screen6.png" width="450" height="250" />
<hr>


<title>Warehouse and resource extraction</title>
Using the warehouse you can build many extraction buildings. There are two types of them - <strong><u>lumberjack and mine</u></strong>. Build them 


as close to the forest or rocks as you can, so he building is used most efficiently. <br />
<br />
<img src="../image/screen7.png" width="450" height="250" />
<hr>


<title>Registration</title>



You can complete the <strong><u>game registration</u></strong> by setting a password. This is important for you to be able to continue to log in later and not let your account be canceled. Then you can easily expand your town, build, and attack.<br />

<title>Other functions</title>
Use the icons at the bottom of the menu to access the player profile and the town profile. These icons appear when you click on any building, whether it is yours or other players. Player profile (town profile) displays a detailed description of the player (town), which can be edited by the owner. Another feature that has already been mentioned is messages and announcements. After clicking on the three dots icon at the bottom of the screen, you can participate in discussions with players, write reports and keep track of their statistics. If you want your town to prosper, you must know who your friend is and who is not. <br />
<br />
<table width="300" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="37">&nbsp;</td>
    <td><img src="../../image/icons/profile_user.png" width="35" height="35" /></td>
    <td><img src="../../image/icons/profile_town.png" width="35" height="35" /></td>

    <td><strong>Player profile</strong> </td>
    <td><strong>Town profile</strong> </td>
    <td><strong>Messages</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br />
<hr>


<title>Tabs</title>
Another interesting feature is tabs. If you do not want to search every building on the map, so that you can select it, you can add it to your tabs. Once you want to see it on the map, you can focus on it in this way. <br />
<br />
<table width="300" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="37">&nbsp;</td>
    <td><img src="../../image/icons/fx_tab.png" width="35" height="35" /></td>
    <td><img src="../../image/icons/fx_center.png" width="35" height="35" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><strong>Add to tabs</strong> </td>
    <td><strong>Center</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<title>Builder, warehouse</title>


After a slow start and first prosperity there comes the expansion of your town. For this purpose it is necessary to build as many buildings as possible and gain as many resources as you can. To be able to constantly build, to have enough workforce, and not be limited by the time counters, it is important to build more builders (buildings). Likewise, if you want to store more resources and build the mine and lumberjack, it is necessary to have plenty of warehouses (these can be built by the builder). This all causes your small village to become a real town.
<br />
<br />
<img src="../image/screen10.png" width="450" height="250" />
<hr>


<title>Trade</title>


Of course, as in real life, you cannot successfully live without <strong><u>trade posts and resources exchange</u></strong>. You can trade your raw materials through various buildings that offer the trade function in varying ratios. The only exception is gold, which all buildings offering trade can exchange in the ratio of 1:1. This means that for one gold you receive one other resource. Exchanging materials is essential in maintaining the stability of your town. With this feature there cannot be the case that you have excess of one resource and lack of other. <br />
<br />
<strong>1) </strong>The basic building through which you can exchange raw materials is the main building. However, it is very inefficient; you can exchange resources in the ratio of 1:10.<br />
<br />
<strong>2) </strong>Another building is the <strong>market</strong>. You can build it through the builder. You can exchange raw materials in the ratio of 1:4.<br />
<br />
<strong>3) </strong>Using the market you can build the <strong>embassy</strong>, where you can exchange resources in the ratio of 1:2.  
<br />

<title>Expansion</title>

  
As you could notice you can build other buildings only on the edge of any black (or red) circle of some of your current building (which appears next to the appropriate  building). This function is called <strong><u>expansion</u></strong>. It used to bind your town together and not let it be divided into independent parts, which would immediately fall into the hands of stronger players. This function allows your town to prosper.
<br />
<br />
<img src="../image/screen12.png" width="450" height="250" />
<hr>


<title>Town defence</title>
Some of your buildings make it impossible for other players to build buildings near them. This function is called <strong><u>antiexpansion</u></strong>. It is used to not allow various towns to be close to each other and thus avoid unrest among their inhabitants. With this feature, towns have increased protection against aggressive players.

<title>Attacks</title>

           
If you want to expand your town, we cannot avoid the fact that some other players may not like it. In this case the attacks come into play. With them you can attack the enemy and destroy their buildings that obstruct or threaten you. Various buildings in your town offer attacks with different efficiency. Beware, however, that the enemy is not stronger than you!<br />
<br />
<u>There are 2 kinds of attack:</u><br />
<strong><br />
1) Total</strong> - destroys the building you are attacking on and you then get part of the raw materials from which it was constructed.<br />
An example of a building with this kind of attack is <strong>assault tower</strong>. <br />
<br />
<strong>2) Occupy</strong> - damages a building at 1 life point and possess it. The building is then yours, but you should fix it. In this way you can expand over larger obstacles.<br />
An example of a building with this kind of attack is <strong>Expansion tower</strong>.
<hr>


<title>Repair a building</title>


If it happens that some of your buildings are damaged (f. e., as a result of enemy attack), you can get it repaired by using the repair icon on the bottom menu. This way you avoid that you build the same building twice next to each other, when the first can be simply repaired to its original state. Residents of your town will be happy to help you.<br />

  </tr>
</table>
<br />
If, on the other hand, some built and undamaged building of yours does not suit you, you can disassemble it or leave it. By dismantling the building disappears and you get part of the raw materials that you have invested in it. In this way, you can f. e. dismantle extraction buildings, which already have no raw materials around them. By leaving it the building remains, but you lose control over it.

<title>Bonus resources</title>


<strong><u>Support us and gain gold!!</u></strong></strong><br>
If you like Towns and would like to help us in the further development and improvement, you can support us and in return receive game gold, which can then be exchanged for classic materials - wood, stone, iron and fuel in a ratio of 1:1.<br>
Other features that you can change the gold for will be soon available.<br>
<br>
The system is in test mode, so it unfortunately only accepts PayPal payments in USD now.
Other payment options will be coming soon.<br>
<br>
We know that Towns needs to be constantly improved and the bugs corrected. We are very grateful for every support, thank you!
